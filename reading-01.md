# Ten Takeaway Points

1. With more of the "general public" using software every day in various devices
(the Internet of Things comes to mind), properly functioning software has never been
more important. However, we need a solid definition of quality before we can measure
our success in that regard.

2. Moreover, quality is relative. We can be more tolerant of errors in notepad
than in air traffic control systems.

3. The business impact of quality is important. If we can't put a dollar figure
on the impact of striving for quality, it is unlikely to be seen as a necessary step.

4. Quality is in the eye of the stakeholder. There exists a "transcendental" version of
quality that claims there is an ideal (in the Platonic sense) quality that we're always
striving for. This view stands in contrast to the more pragmatic views of the user and manufacturer,
who are generally more interested in function and fulfillment of specification.

5. Definitions of quality that ignore constraints are lacking. Both functional and non-functional
requirements need to be satisfied, including implicit requirements.

6. Users care about reliability, ease of installation/learning, and usability. These can be measured,
generally through measuring time quantities like uptime and the time required to reach a given
level of mastery. Meanwhile, manufacturers are generally concerned with avoiding rework during
and after the product is built.

7. An early attempt to model quality can be found in McCall's quality model. Quality is defined
as a hierarchy of factors, criteria, and metrics. Metrics are associated with criteria. For example,
portability can be defined as the composition of modularity, machine independence, and other factors.
However, this measure is inherently subjective, as metrics like "modularity" are defined as responses
to yes or no questions that the user provides.

8. ISO 9126 is a more recent attempt at modelling software quality. This ISO standard measures
"ilities" like reliability, usability, etc. It suggests decomposing these measures into more
specific metrics, but provides little guidance on how to accomplish this. As a result, it suffers
from the same issues of vagueness as McCall's model.

9. Dromey's model dispenses with the earlier hierarchical models in an attempt to avoid their
shortcomings. Instead, he proposes a component-based approach wherein software engineers
ensure their components exhibit a consistent and complete set of product properties
that result in the manifestation of higher level attributes like maintainability.

10. Framing quality in terms of business needs is of utmost importance. Sometimes, "good enough"
is good, while other times, "good enough" can lead to loss of human life. Any further attempts to define
quality and measure it must me malleable enough to work within these constraints.
