## Manual Reviews

* Improves reliability, but is very labor intensive
* Thus, is is the first to get cut when the project is behind schedule
* Generally this is very informal, and thus it is not repeatable

## Software Inspections

* Developed by Fagan in 1972
* Formal roles of moderator, designer, coder, scribe
* No more than two hours
* Possibly have an apprentice who is learning about software inspection
* Each participant has a specific task
* Make it as impersonal as possible so that people aren't turned off from the process
* 15% increase in pre-code cost for inspections, but decreased overall costs
* Reduced faults by 2/3
* Found 60-90% of faults during inspection
* Hawthorne effect can automatically increase quality of code
* Tends to focus on error detection instead of other qualities
* Difficult to apply consistently across different environments
* Study found that two person teams were most effective
* Possibly influenced pair programming techniques
* Companies that report success with inspections have well-defined guidelines
